# Database Migration Scripts Archive

## fix-username-completed-2025-08-14.js

**Purpose:** One-time migration script to update existing user usernames from email/phone format to full-name format.

**Execution Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Successfully Completed  
**Users Updated:** 2 users  

**Results:**
- User 1: "andrew_sandy" (from "Andrew Sandy")
- User 2: "system_administrator" (from "System Administrator")

**Usage:** This script was used during the implementation of automatic username generation. New users now get usernames auto-generated from their full names, so this script should not need to be run again under normal circumstances.

**Note:** Keep this file for reference and potential future use if username regeneration is ever needed again.
